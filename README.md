# Gene Expression Analysis using Gemini 3


## 🚀 Overview

This repository demonstrates how to combine conventional RNA-seq gene expression analysis with the language model Gemini 3 to accelerate biological interpretation. We use the publicly available Airway RNA-seq Benchmark Dataset to walk through a complete pipeline — from loading raw count data to differential expression and high-level biological interpretation — leveraging Gemini 3 for contextual summarization, annotation, and insight generation.

By integrating AI-powered interpretation with standard computational genomics workflows, this project illustrates how researchers can reduce manual effort and speed up the discovery process, without sacrificing scientific rigor.


## 🧬 Dataset

* **Airway RNA-seq Benchmark Dataset** — a compact, publicly available RNA-seq experiment tracking how airway cells respond to dexamethasone treatment. As described in the accompanying blog post, the dataset is ideal as a beginner-friendly benchmark for differential expression workflows. 

## ⚙️ Setup & Usage

### Prerequisites

* Python (tested with 3.9+)
* A working environment capable of running Jupyter Notebooks (e.g., Jupyter Lab or Notebook)
* Access credentials for Gemini 3 from Google AI Studio

## 🔎 What This Project Demonstrates

* A reproducible pipeline for RNA-seq differential expression analysis using a benchmark dataset
* Integration of AI (Gemini 3) for **biological interpretation and summarization** — helping to translate raw gene lists and statistics into human-readable insights
* How modern generative AI can augment standard bioinformatics workflows, making them more efficient and interpretable
